      <description>Study Overview The paper Improving analytical reasoning and argument understanding: a quasi-experimental field study of argument visualization (Cullen et al. 2018) studies the impact of training in argument visualization on analytical reasoning. The authors hypothesized that training students to visualize the logical structure of presented arguments would lead to improvements on the logical reasoning section of the LSAT. To investigate this hypothesis, they created a 12 week seminar course for freshman students at Princeton consisting of group and individual practice of visualizing arguments.</description>

      <description>Study Overview In the basic RNN, the vanishing gradient problem limits a language model&amp;rsquo;s memory; a range of models, such as LSTM and GRU, have been developed to reduce this friction. In order to preserve long-term memory, these models must determine which information to store from previous hidden states. This introduces a related problemâ€“if the model chooses the wrong information to carry in its long-term memory, it may be difficult to recover.</description>
